  University clusters and supercomputers often cannot access SQS easily
  but have access to a common file system. It would be a pain to have t
  o set up a RabbitMQ instance or similar process on each cluster we
  get access to, so it would be ideal to have a queue system that just
  runs off the filesystem.

  We need the following properties from our queue:

    Serverless
    Durable - No losses from power outages and process crashes.
    Supports Verbs - queue create, queue delete, task create,
      time limited task lease, task delete, task lease extend,
      and reset tasks leases.
    Parallel Safe
    Recirculating Tasks - If a process fails, eventually the
      task will be picked up by another one.
    Supports millions of tasks.
    Can be operated by a pipeline technician without help
      (or need onerous approvals) from a cluster administrator.

  File Queues in principle fulfill the first two properties as the
  server is the filesystem and files do not disappear on power loss
  or process crash. On journaling filesystems, the files do not even
  become corrupted on power loss in the middle of writing. Filesystems
  support millions of files in a single directory, but certain operations
  like listing become unusable. Properties 3 through 6 will require
  careful design. We anticipate that these queues can be run from
  userland and require no special approvals to be used unless the queues
  are very large, in which case the entire job will likely need special
  approval anyway.

  With respect to the verbs specified, all should be familiar from SQS
  with one exception: reset task leases is new and is extremely useful
  for resetting a job that has partially run but crashed when the lease
  time is very long.
